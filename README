Here's how to use this easy little script:
-------------
1. Change the properties at the top of the file to the repo/user 
	you want to fetch
2. Change the location for the PHP binary to match your system
3. Be sure the $_file path can be written to (or change it)

What it does:
------------
The script connects to the Github API and pulls down the entire
issues list in a json format. It then caches this whole result 
where the file path points to and all following commands use this
cached copy for their queries.

The time to live for the file refresh is two days from the creation
of the cache file.

Actions:
-----------
1. list (default): gives complete listing of all issues in the cached copy
2. detail: gives detail listing of issue when given the issue number

Future Ideas:
----------
1. Allow comment updates, pushed when script next connects to github
2. Create new comments/issues
